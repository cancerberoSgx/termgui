# spawn given command using pty. This gives access both to commandÂ´s stdin and stdout.
# How this works is looping until the process ends, reading stdout and notifying on each iteration.
# a simple timer is supported so operations like set_timeout or wait_until are supported (See TimeDriver and WaitDriver)
# users can register for new stdout data (to assert against)
# users can simulate keypress events
# be notified when stdout matches something
# This is the base class that is extended for adding more high level APIs
